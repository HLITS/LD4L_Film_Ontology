The raw 16mm stock was coated with glue and powdered metal (first nickel & silver, next strip got graphite, and the third got gold) then shocked using a small Tesla coil in the Carpenter Center’s lecture hall before a large audience.  The film was then processed (again, before the audience’s very eyes), dried (with the help of a Harvard student and his hair drier), and given to HFA film conservator Liz Coffey to project from the middle of the theatre using two Eiki slot-load projector with sound.  The first loop projected was still too damp and was damaged by the projector.  The remaining two loops ran fine for about 20 minutes, during which time they became scratched by the projector, not to the dismay of the filmmaker, who assures us that always happens.","ExperimentalAvant GardeArt & Artists","","B/W","","16mm","","","","","","Mono","16mm.","2008","4/8/2008","","","","[Electrocuted film loops]","","","CC13J2L","","","1","","","No","6","","footage is approximate.
