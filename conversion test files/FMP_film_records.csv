The raw 16mm stock was coated with glue and powdered metal (first nickel & silver, next strip got graphite, and the third got gold) then shocked using a small Tesla coil in the Carpenter Center’s lecture hall before a large audience.  The film was then processed (again, before the audience’s very eyes), dried (with the help of a Harvard student and his hair drier), and given to HFA film conservator Liz Coffey to project from the middle of the theatre using two Eiki slot-load projector with sound.  The first loop projected was still too damp and was damaged by the projector.  The remaining two loops ran fine for about 20 minutes, during which time they became scratched by the projector, not to the dismay of the filmmaker, who assures us that always happens.","ExperimentalAvant GardeArt & Artists","","B/W","","16mm","","","","","","Mono","16mm.","2008","4/8/2008","","","","[Electrocuted film loops]","","","CC13J2L","","","1","","","No","6","","footage is approximate.

"Mauritania / Algeria","Fiction Feature","","Med Hondo","","","","","","""Med Hondo’s West Indies is a revolutionary musical in both senses of the word. This witty, scathing production offers an angry view of West Indian history, using imaginative staging and a fluid visual style. The film’s single set is an enormous slave ship [built in an unused Citroen factory in Paris]. . . . Mobile camerawork and frequent narrative shifts take the actors through various vignettes about French colonialists invading the Indies, Carribean natives lured to Paris, the process by which the islands were first settled and a lot more. The material has the potential for overbearing irony . . . [but] Mr. Hondo has a light touch. . . . With cast members rotating their way through many different roles (the same actors may play slaves, then worried island villagers, then displaced West Indians) . . . Mr. Hondo leads the film through a long series of well-connected tableaux, culminating in an almost joyous call to arms.""—Janet Maslin, New York Times","Drama","","Color","","35mm","","","","","","Mono","","1979","5/24/2000","","","","West Indies","","","CC13VL5CC13VL6","113","","6","1.85:1","French","Yes","10376","","35mm color print in excellent condition.All reels are uncut.reel 1:  1228’ from tailreel 2:  1824’ from tailreel 3:  1828’ from tailreel 4:  1935’ from tailreel 5:  1703’ from tailreel 6:  1858’ from tail","","excellent","","","3144","","10170","4068","","115","4140","10350","0","","FictionFiction ","","","","","","Purchased with  McMillan Reba Stewart Fellowship funds35mm color print in excellent condition","","","","","","","","","","","CC13VKZCC13VL0CC13VL1CC13VL2CC13VL3CC13VL4","","13130131","6","1","","","","","","","","","","","","A.
